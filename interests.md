During my leisure time, I usually play League of Legends with my friends. Since I'm not that good, I'm usually only playing modes like Nexus Blitz or ARAM, but it is still a fun game anyways.

Before, I used to be very interested in Rubik's Cube, and I did a lot of speedruns (with my fastest record being around 14 seconds), but I later realized that it was a bit too much of rote learning when memorizing the formulas, so later I decided to not continue with this interest.

I am also interested in using mechanical pencils from different brands. Here is my own tier list: [Mechanical Pencil Tier List](https://gallnt.github.io/personal-page/mech-pencils.html)
